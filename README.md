# Liri Application

# Introduction

Greetings and thank you for reviewing my Liri App! LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI was developed as a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

### the technologies Liri requires to function are: 

   * [Node-Spotify-API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-spotify-api)

   * [Moment](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment)

   * [DotEnv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)

   * [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios)

### liri was developed by:

* Jason Ostergren - Full Stack Developer
