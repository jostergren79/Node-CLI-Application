# Liri

# Intro

Greetings and thank you for reviewing my Liri App! LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI was developed as a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

These are the APIs Liri requires to function are: 

   * [Node-Spotify-API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-spotify-api)

   * [Moment](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment)

   * [DotEnv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)

Liri will be using Axios to grab data from the [OMDB API](http://www.omdbapi.com) and [Bands In Town API](http://www.artists.bandsintown.com/bandsintown-api)

   * [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios)

    
Here's a screen recording of Liri's functionality for you to view:
